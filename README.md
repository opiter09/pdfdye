Overview
========

**pdfdye** changes text color in PDF files. It changes all the text to a single color of your choosing.

Usage
========

If you want to use it as originally intended, go to the command line and type ``python pdfdye.py -c RRGGBB INPUT-FILE OUTPUT-FILE``.
Alternatively, I (the forker) have created a GUI for this program, which can be found in the Releases section of this repository.
This GUI does not require Python, only Windows (or WINE_).

Prerequisites
=============

* Python 3.X
* pikepdf_ ≥ 3.0.0
