Overview
========

**pdfdye** changes text color in PDF files.

Usage
========

If you want to use it as originally intended, go to the command line and type ``python pdfdye.py -c {RRGGBB} {INPUT-FILE} {OUTPUT-FILE}``.
Alternatively, I (the forker) have created a GUI for this program, which can be found in the Releases section of this repository.
This GUI does not require Python, only Windows (or WINE: https://www.winehq.org).

Prerequisites
=============

* Python 3.X
* pikepdf_ â‰¥ 3.0.0

.. _pikepdf:
   https://pypi.org/project/pikepdf/
